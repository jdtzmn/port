# Port Onboarding

Port is a CLI for managing git worktrees that makes it easy to create, enter, and tear down parallel working copies of your repo. When those worktrees run Docker Compose services, Port can automatically stand up a Traefik reverse proxy so every worktree can bind the same ports without conflicts — each accessed via its own hostname (e.g., \`feature-1.port:3000\`).

## Recommended Flow

### 1. \`port init\`

- **How**: Run in your repository root if setup has not been done yet (check with port status first).
- **Why**: Creates .port config, hooks, and worktree directories.

### 2. \`port install\`

- **How**: Run once per machine (or when changing domain/IP).
- **Why**: Configures wildcard DNS so branch domains resolve locally.

### 3. \`port shell-hook <bash|zsh|fish>\`

- **How**: Add eval "$(port shell-hook bash)" to your shell profile (one-time setup).
- **Why**: Enables port enter/exit to change your shell directory automatically.

### 4. \`port enter <branch>\`

- **How**: Use explicit enter, especially when branch names match commands.
- **Why**: Creates or enters the branch worktree and changes into it.

### 5. \`port up\`

- **How**: Run inside a worktree after entering it.
- **Why**: Starts services and wires routing through Traefik.

### 6. \`port urls [service]\`

- **How**: Run in a worktree or repository root.
- **Why**: Shows the exact branch URLs to open and share.

### 7. \`port status\`

- **How**: Run anytime when you need service-level visibility.
- **Why**: Shows running/stopped services across all worktrees.

### 8. \`port down\`

- **How**: Run in a worktree when you are done testing.
- **Why**: Stops project services and offers Traefik shutdown when appropriate.

### 9. \`port exit\`

- **How**: Run to return to the repository root from a worktree.
- **Why**: Changes back to the repo root and clears PORT_WORKTREE env var.

### 10. \`port remove <branch>\`

- **How**: Use after a branch is done.
- **Why**: Stops services, removes worktree, and archives the local branch.

## Useful Checks

- \`port list\`: quick worktree and host-service summary
- \`port kill [port]\`: stop host processes started with port run
- \`port cleanup\`: delete archived local branches from port remove
